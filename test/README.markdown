# Testing

Run the tests with `ruby tcs_test.rb` or `ruby test/tcs_test.rb` depending on which directory you're in.

To add a new test case, add a pair of fixture files.  For example:

```
test/fixtures/some_edge_case.html             # the HTML source
test/fixtures/some_edge_case.expected.html    # the expected result
```
