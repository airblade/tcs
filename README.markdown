# tcs - Tailwind Class Sorter

A standalone script which sorts the classes in your HTML following Tailwind's [recommended class order](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted).  It does not require [Prettier](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier).

You can run it on the command line or integrate it with your text editor.


## Features

- It sorts the classes in your HTML according to Tailwind's recommended order.
- It leaves the rest of your HTML alone.
- It does not require Prettier.


## Installation

Requires Ruby.

Copy the `tcs` script onto your PATH and make sure it is executable (e.g. `chmod +x tcs`).


## Usage

```
tcs CSS_FILE HTML_FILE      # updates HTML_FILE
tcs CSS_FILE < HTML_FILE    # writes HTML to stdout
```

Unknown classes are written to stderr.

The first argument is the CSS file generated by Tailwind (not the one with the `@tailwind` directives).

Either give the HTML file as the second argument, which will update it in place; or feed the source HTML into stdin, which will write the updated HTML to stdout.


## Examples

Write the processed HTML to the console:

```
tcs css/tailwind.css < index.html
```

Write the processed HTML to the source file:

```
tcs css/tailwind.css < index.html > index.html
```

Dry run: see what `tcs` does, without updating your HTML:

```
tcs css/tailwind.css < index.html | git diff --no-index index.html -
```

Update your HTML file directly:

```
tcs css/tailwind.css index.html
```
